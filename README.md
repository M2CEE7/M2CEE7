## üíº **Portfolio Highlights**
Here are a few of my featured projects:


### [Apptivate University Query Management System](https://github.com/7TrentF/Apptivate_UQMS.git)
This web-based application is designed to streamline the management of user accounts, queries, and system activities within a university setting. The Admin Dashboard provides comprehensive tools for administrators and staff to efficiently oversee and handle various aspects of the system, ensuring a smooth and effective user experience.
In which I worked on creating the chat functionalitiy, working on the various UI components, working with the API's on the mobile and website.
### [AgriEnergy Connect ](https://github.com/M2CEE7/AgriEnergyConnect.git)
Agri-Energy Connect is a web-based platform built with ASP.NET MVC that streamlines agricultural operations by enabling farmers to manage product inventories and employees to oversee farmer profiles and product data. The application uses Entity Framework Core for database management and integrates ASP.NET Identity for secure, role-based authentication. With a clean MVC architecture, responsive Razor views, and SQL Server for data storage, this project demonstrates expertise in building full-stack applications with robust backend functionality and intuitive user interfaces.
